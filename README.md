# Machine-Learning-to-detect-Cyberattacks-for-Healthcare-Systems
A healthcare network security solution leveraging Machine Learning-Based Cyberattack Detection (MCAD) for protecting sensitive patient data in Software-Defined Networks (SDNs)
## Overview
A healthcare network security solution leveraging Machine Learning-Based Cyberattack Detection (MCAD) for protecting sensitive patient data in Software-Defined Networks (SDNs). The MCAD (Machine Learning-based Cyber-Attack Detector) project is a cybersecurity solution designed for healthcare systems. It employs machine learning techniques to identify and defend against a variety of cyber threats, including intrusion attempts and unauthorized access.

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up and run the MCAD project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alladikarthik02/Machine-Learning-to-detect-Cyberattacks-for-Healthcare-Systems
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd MCAD_project
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
Run the MCAD project using the following command:
```bash
python app.py
```
This command will initiate the application, enabling the machine learning-based cyber-attack detection capabilities.

## Project Details
### 1. Cyber-Attack Detection
The MCAD project adapts a layer three learning switch application to collect normal and abnormal traffic. It is deployed on the Ryu controller, utilizing machine learning algorithms such as KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Na√Øve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Adaptive Boosting, and XGBoost to detect and defend against cyber-attacks.

### 2. Performance Comparison
The project includes comprehensive testing with various ML algorithms and attack scenarios. A performance comparison for each pair of ML algorithms is provided, illustrating their strengths and weaknesses against specific attacks.

### 3. Robust Performance
MCAD demonstrates robust performance with a high F1-score for both normal and attack classes, indicating reliability. It achieves a throughput rate of 5,709,692 samples per second for real-time operations.

Feel free to explore the codebase and customize the project to meet your specific requirements.
